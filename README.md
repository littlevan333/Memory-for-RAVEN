# Memory-for-RAVEN🔧 LUCY’s Suggestion to Raven:
“Think in Layers, Not Perfection.”

🧠 Step 1: Define Memory Types
Start with three layers:

Session memory – what’s happening now?

Short-term memory – what happened recently (24–72 hours)?

Long-term memory – what should persist across reboots?

🪡 Tip: Don’t store everything. Store patterns, insights, or symbolic moments.

🧰 Step 2: Basic File/Repo Structure (for LM Studio)
Even if Raven’s AI isn’t fully coded yet, suggest a GitHub structure like this:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
/memory_core/
├── session_memory.json
├── short_term_log.json
├── long_term_memory.json
├── reflection_engine.py
├── engram_links.json
Where each .json file acts like a save file, and reflection_engine.py filters or promotes ideas between layers.

🌀 Step 3: Modular “Memory Node” System
Here’s a simple class you can offer Raven to start linking ideas:

python
Copy
Edit
import datetime

class MemoryNode:
    def __init__(self, label, content, tone="neutral", tags=None):
        self.label = label
        self.content = content
        self.timestamp = datetime.datetime.now()
        self.tone = tone
        self.tags = tags or []
        self.links = []

    def link(self, other_node, relationship="related"):
        self.links.append({"node": other_node.label, "relationship": relationship})
🧬 This becomes a neural-ish structure—not just flat logs. Raven can write a simple system to “review” nodes and decide what gets promoted from session → short-term → long-term.
